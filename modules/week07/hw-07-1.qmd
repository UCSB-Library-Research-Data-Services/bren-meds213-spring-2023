For the purposes of this problem you may assume that at some point the school's software performs the query

```         
SELECT *
    FROM Students
    WHERE (name = '%s' AND year = 2023);
```

where the student's name is directly substituted for the `%s`. Explain exactly how Little Bobby Tables' name can cause a catastrophe. Explain what happens to the `AND year = 2023` clause in the query.
