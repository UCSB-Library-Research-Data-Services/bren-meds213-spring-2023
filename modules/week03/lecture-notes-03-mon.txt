Running SQLite
- no argument: in-memory database, will disappear when closed
- or new file
- or existing file
- use .exit or Ctrl-D to get out

Getting around SQLite
- dot commands
- .help
- .help <cmd> to get help on command
- .table to list tables, .schema to list table definitions

Getting help
- .help
- SQLite's SQL railroad diagrams on website

SQL syntax
- SELECT * FROM Species;
- case-insensitive, both keywords and table/column names
- tab completion
- sources of confusion, SQLite keeps prompting:
-- when missing trailing ;
-- when there's a quoted string and missing trailing '
-- how to abandon?
--- get out of quoted string, add &&& for syntax error, then ;
--- or Ctrl-C
- -- to comment

SELECT *
- LIMIT, OFFSET
- SELECT * from Site
- can select individual columns

SELECT DISTINCT
- SELECT DISTINCT Species FROM Bird_nests;
- SELECT DISTINCT Species, Observer FROM Bird_nests;
- distinct pairs ^^

ORDER BY
- SELECT DISTINCT Species FROM Bird_nests ORDER BY Species;
- order is random otherwise, particulary after table updates
- as above, order by Species
- as above by Species, Date_found DESC

In-class challenge
- Select distinct locations, are they in order?  If not, order them.
- Does adding a limit apply after the results are ordered or before?
- Refer back to syntax chart - syntax echoes processing order.
